## What is FPVGate?

FPVGate is a lap timer that measures the time it takes to complete a lap by detecting your drone's video transmitter signal strength (RSSI). When you fly through the gate, the timer detects the peak RSSI and records your lap time. It's perfect for:

- Personal practice sessions
- Small indoor tracks (even in your living room!)
- 2-3 inch whoops and micro quads
- Solo training and improvement tracking

## How It Works

FPVGate uses an **RX5808 video receiver module** to continuously monitor the RSSI (signal strength) of your drone's video transmitter. As your drone approaches the gate, the RSSI increases, peaks when you're closest, then decreases as you fly away.

The system uses two thresholds:
- **Enter RSSI** - Signal strength when you start crossing
- **Exit RSSI** - Signal strength when crossing ends

A lap is recorded when the RSSI rises above Enter, peaks, then falls below Exit. The time between peaks = your lap time.

The ESP32-S3 runs a web server that you connect to via WiFi. Configuration, race control, and live RSSI visualization all happen through your phone or tablet's web browser.

**Don't forget to click "Save Configuration" after making changes!**

### Calibration

**Calibration is critical for accurate timing.** Follow these steps carefully:

#### Step 1: Prepare
1. Power on FPVGate and your drone
2. Wait **30 seconds** for the VTx to reach operating temperature
3. Navigate to the **Calibration** tab in the web interface

#### Step 2: Observe Baseline RSSI
1. Place your drone **one gate distance away** from FPVGate
   - For living room: ~3-4 feet
   - For outdoor track: ~6-8 feet
2. Watch the **RSSI graph** - note the peak value as you hold the drone at gate distance

#### Step 3: Set Thresholds
1. **Enter RSSI**: Set to **2-5 points below** the observed peak
   - This is when FPVGate starts "watching" for a lap
   
2. **Exit RSSI**: Set to **8-10 points below** Enter RSSI
   - This is when FPVGate stops "watching" and records the lap

3. Click **"Save RSSI Thresholds"**

#### Understanding the Graph
- **Blue Area** = Clear zone (no drone nearby)
- **Green Area** = Crossing zone (drone passing through gate)
- **Red Line** = Enter RSSI threshold
- **Orange Line** = Exit RSSI threshold

#### Good vs Bad Calibration

**✅ Good Calibration:**
```
RSSI  │     /\
      │    /  \
      │   /    \     ← Single clean peak
Enter ├──/──────\───
      │ /        \
Exit  ├/──────────\─
      └─────────────── Time
```

**❌ Bad Calibration (thresholds too low):**
```
RSSI  │   /\/\    ← Multiple peaks = multiple laps!
      │  /    \
Enter ├─/──────\───
      │/        \
Exit  /──────────\─
      └─────────────── Time
```

#### Tips
- **Flying with others?** Lower both thresholds by 3-5 points to account for RF noise
- **Lots of false laps?** Increase Exit RSSI or increase Minimum Lap Time
- **Missing laps?** Lower Enter RSSI threshold
- **Test your calibration** by flying a few practice laps and watching the graph

## Troubleshooting

### WiFi Connection Issues
**Problem**: Can't find FPVGate network  
**Solution**: 
- Make sure device is powered on (5V to VBUS)
- Wait 10 seconds after power-on for network to appear
- Check for network name: `FPVGate_XXXX`

**Problem**: Wrong password  
**Solution**: Password is `fpvgate1` (8 characters, all lowercase)

**Problem**: Can't access web interface  
**Solution**: Try both URLs:
- `http://www.fpvgate.xyz`
- `http://192.168.4.1`

### Flashing/Upload Issues
**Problem**: "Port doesn't exist" error  
**Solution**: 
- Use a **data-capable** USB-C cable (some are charge-only)
- Try different USB ports
- Check Device Manager (Windows) for COM port

**Problem**: "Timed out waiting for packet header" error  
**Solution**: 
- Disconnect RX5808 RSSI wire from GPIO4 temporarily
- GPIO3 is a strapping pin - never connect to it
- Hold BOOT button while plugging in USB

### Timing/Calibration Issues
**Problem**: Missing laps  
**Solution**: 
- Lower Enter RSSI threshold by 5 points
- Ensure VTx has warmed up (30 seconds minimum)
- Check that Band/Channel matches your drone

**Problem**: Too many false laps  
**Solution**: 
- Increase Minimum Lap Time to 12-15 seconds
- Raise Exit RSSI threshold by 3-5 points
- Move timer further from flight path

**Problem**: Inconsistent lap detection  
**Solution**: 
- Ensure stable 5V power supply
- Check for loose RX5808 connections
- Re-calibrate when flying with other pilots

### RGB LED Issues
**Problem**: External LEDs not working  
**Solution**: 
- Verify 5V power to LED strip (VBUS pin)
- Check data wire connection to GPIO18
- Ensure `NUM_LEDS` in `rgbled.h` matches your strip
- WS2812 LEDs need 5V, not 3.3V

**Problem**: Wrong colors or random behavior  
**Solution**: 
- Confirm WS2812 LED type (not WS2811 or SK6812)
- Check wiring: VBUS=5V, GND=GND, GPIO18=Data
- Add 100-330Ω resistor on data line if experiencing issues

## Default Settings

- **WiFi SSID**: `FPVGate_XXXX`
- **WiFi Password**: `fpvgate1`
- **Default Channel**: RaceBand 8 (5917 MHz)
- **Web Address**: `http://www.fpvgate.xyz` or `http://192.168.4.1`
- **Minimum Lap**: 5 seconds
- **Default Lap Count**: Infinite (0)
- **Default Theme**: Material Oceanic
- **Default Pilot Color**: Blue
- **RGB LED Pin**: GPIO18

## Credits

FPVGate is a heavily modified fork of [PhobosLT](https://github.com/phobos-/PhobosLT) by phobos-. 

The original PhobosLT project provided the foundation for RSSI-based lap timing. FPVGate adds ESP32-S3 support, RGB LED indicators, a modernized web interface, and various improvements for personal use.

Portions of the timing logic are inspired by [RotorHazard](https://github.com/RotorHazard/RotorHazard).
