## What is FPVGate?

FPVGate measures lap times by detecting your drone's video transmitter signal strength (RSSI). When you fly through the gate, it detects the peak signal and records your lap time. No transponders, no complex setup—just plug in, calibrate, and fly.

## Quick Start

### 1. Hardware You'll Need

| Component | Required | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1** | Yes | Main controller |
| **RX5808 Module** | Yes | 5.8GHz receiver ([SPI mod required](https://sheaivey.github.io/rx5808-pro-diversity/docs/rx5808-spi-mod.html)) |
| **MicroSD Card** | Yes | FAT32, 1GB+ for audio storage |
| **5V Power Supply** | Yes | 18650 battery + regulator |
| **WS2812 RGB LEDs** | Optional | 1-2 LEDs for visual feedback |
| **Active Buzzer** | Optional | 3.3V-5V for beeps |

### 2. Basic Wiring

```
ESP32-S3        RX5808
GPIO4    ────── RSSI
GPIO10   ────── CH1 (DATA)
GPIO11   ────── CH2 (SELECT)
GPIO12   ────── CH3 (CLOCK)
GND      ────── GND
5V       ────── +5V
```

**[See complete wiring guide →](docs/HARDWARE_GUIDE.md)**

### 3. Flash Firmware

**Option A: Prebuilt Binaries (Recommended)**
```bash
# Download from releases page, then flash:
esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port COM3 write_flash -z \
  0x0 bootloader.bin \
  0x8000 partitions.bin \
  0x10000 firmware.bin \
  0x410000 littlefs.bin
```

**Option B: Build from Source**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LouisHitchcock/FPVGate.git
cd FPVGate
pio run -e ESP32S3 -t upload
pio run -e ESP32S3 -t uploadfs
```

**[Detailed setup guide →](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)**

### 4. Connect and Configure

**WiFi (Default):**
1. Connect to `FPVGate_XXXX` network (password: `fpvgate1`)
2. Open `http://www.fpvgate.xyz` or `http://192.168.4.1`
3. Go to Configuration → Set your VTx frequency
4. Go to Calibration → Set RSSI thresholds
5. Start racing!

**USB (Electron App):**
1. Download [Electron app from releases](https://github.com/LouisHitchcock/FPVGate/releases)
2. Connect ESP32-S3 via USB
3. Launch app and select COM port
4. All features work identically to WiFi mode

## How It Works

FPVGate uses an RX5808 video receiver module to monitor your drone's RSSI (signal strength). As you fly through the gate:

1. **Approach** - RSSI rises above Enter threshold → crossing starts
2. **Peak** - RSSI peaks when you're closest to the gate
3. **Exit** - RSSI falls below Exit threshold → lap recorded

The time between peaks = your lap time. Simple, reliable, and accurate.

```
RSSI  │     /\
      │    /  \
      │   /    \     ← Single clean peak
Enter ├──/──────\───
      │ /        \
Exit  ├/──────────\─
      └─────────────── Time
```
