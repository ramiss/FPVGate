## [1.1.0] - 2025-11-28

### Added - Natural Voice TTS System
- **Hybrid TTS System** with three-tier fallback:
  - Primary: ElevenLabs pre-recorded audio (natural, high-quality)
  - Secondary: Piper TTS via WASM (good quality, offline)
  - Fallback: Web Speech API (browser default)
- **Natural Number Pronunciation**: Numbers 0-99 spoken naturally
  - "11.44" → "eleven point forty-four" (not "one one point four four")
  - Instant audio transitions with <50ms gaps between clips
- **Voice Generation Scripts**:
  - `generate_voice_files.py` - Main generator with ElevenLabs API
  - `generate_all_voices.py` - Generate all 4 voice options
  - Support for 4 voices: Sarah (energetic), Rachel (calm), Adam (male), Antoni (male)
- **Comprehensive Audio Library**:
  - 100 number files (0-99) for natural time announcements
  - Race control phrases (arm_your_quad, starting_tone, gate_1, race_complete)
  - Lap numbers 1-50 for "Lap X" announcements
  - Pilot-specific audio (pilot_lap.mp3, test_sound.mp3)
- **Optimized Audio Playback**:
  - 1.3x playback speed for faster announcements
  - Audio caching for instant replay
  - `preservesPitch = false` for better quality at higher speeds
  - Early audio completion detection (50ms before end)

### Added - UI/UX Improvements
- **Redesigned Lap Table**:
  - New columns: Lap No | Lap Time | Gap | Total Time
  - Gap column shows difference from previous lap (+0.23s or -0.15s)
  - Total Time shows cumulative race time
  - Data attributes for lap indexing
- **Fastest Lap Highlighting**:
  - Gold/orange highlight (#f39c12) on fastest lap row
  - Subtle glow effect for visual distinction
  - Dynamically updates as new laps are completed
  - Excludes Gate 1 from fastest lap calculation
- **Enhanced Lap Analysis Stats**:
  - **Fastest Lap**: Shows lap number (e.g., "Lap 5" or "Gate 1")
  - **Fastest 3 Consecutive**: NEW - RaceGOW format support (e.g., "G1-L1-L2")
  - **Best 3 Laps**: Sum of 3 fastest individual laps (non-consecutive)
  - **Median Lap**: Statistical middle lap time
- **Configurable Lap Announcement Formats**:
  - Full: "Louis Lap 5, 12.34"
  - Lap + Time: "Lap 5, 12.34"
  - Time Only: "12.34"
  - Saved to localStorage for persistence

### Changed
- **"Hole Shot" → "Gate 1"**: More intuitive terminology
- **Race Start Audio**: Fixed timing - beep now plays AFTER voice announcements complete
- **Stop Race**: Now clears audio queue to prevent race start sounds
- **Audio File Organization**: Custom 3.94MB filesystem partition for expanded storage
- **Partition Table**: Custom 8MB layout (2MB app0 + 2MB app1 + 3.94MB filesystem)

### Fixed
- **Race stop beep bug**: Removed unwanted start beep when stopping race
- **Audio gaps**: Eliminated 200ms pauses between audio clips
- **Queue processing**: Removed 100ms gaps between announcements
- **Fastest lap color**: Changed from primary theme color to gold for distinction
- **Lap time gaps**: Now calculated correctly (difference from previous lap, not total)

### Technical
- **Audio Caching**: Map-based caching system for instant audio replay
- **Smart Preloading**: `oncanplay` event for faster first-play
- **Filesystem**: Upgraded from 1.5MB to 3.94MB partition
- **Audio Files**: 217 total files, 3.1MB (2.3MB compressed on device)
- **API Usage**: ~5,000 characters of ElevenLabs API (50% of free tier)

### Documentation
- Added `VOICE_GENERATION_README.md` - Complete voice setup guide
- Added `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history tracking
- Updated README.md with v1.1.0 features

### Developer Experience
- Python scripts for voice generation with progress tracking
- Auto-save configuration for voice selection and lap format
- localStorage persistence for frontend-only settings
- Comprehensive console logging for audio debugging
