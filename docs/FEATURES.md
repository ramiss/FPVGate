## Lap Timing System

### RSSI-Based Detection

**Principle:**  
Drone VTx signal strength (RSSI) peaks when passing through gate.

**How It Works:**

1. **Tuning:** RX5808 tuned to pilot's frequency via SPI
2. **Monitoring:** RSSI sampled at ~100Hz (every 10ms)
3. **Detection Logic:**
   - RSSI rises above **Enter Threshold** ? Start watching
   - RSSI peaks ? Record timestamp
   - RSSI falls below **Exit Threshold** ? Lap confirmed

**State Machine:**

```
     IDLE
      ? (RSSI > Enter)
   CROSSING
      ? (RSSI peaks)
   RECORD_TIME
      ? (RSSI < Exit)
   LAP_CONFIRMED ? Broadcast event
      ?
   COOLDOWN (minimum lap time)
      ?
     IDLE
```

**Advantages:**
- No additional hardware on drone
- Works with any VTx
- Accurate to ~10ms
- No line-of-sight issues (unlike IR)

**Calibration Requirements:**
- **Enter RSSI:** 2-5 points below peak
- **Exit RSSI:** 8-10 points below Enter
- **Minimum Lap Time:** Prevents false triggers

### Frequency Management

**Supported Bands:**
- **A (Boscam A):** 8 channels (5865-5725 MHz)
- **B (Boscam B):** 8 channels (5733-5866 MHz)
- **E (Boscam E):** 8 channels (5705-5945 MHz)
- **F (Fatshark):** 8 channels (5740-5880 MHz)
- **R (RaceBand):** 8 channels (5658-5917 MHz)
- **L (LowBand):** 8 channels (5362-5621 MHz)

**Total:** 48 unique frequencies (some overlap)

**Tuning Process:**
1. User selects band + channel in Configuration
2. Frequency calculated from lookup table
3. RX5808 programmed via SPI commands
4. Confirmation read from module
5. RSSI monitoring begins

**SPI Communication:**
- **Clock:** 1 MHz (GPIO15)
- **Data:** Single wire (GPIO13)
- **Chip Select:** GPIO14
- **Protocol:** 25-bit register writes

**Register Format:**
```
| R/W (1) | Address (4) | Data (20) |
```

### Timing Accuracy

**Factors Affecting Accuracy:**

| Factor | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **RSSI Sampling Rate** | �5ms | 100Hz sampling |
| **Peak Detection** | �10ms | 3-point average |
| **System Timer** | �1ms | millis() function |
| **WiFi Latency** | 20-30ms | Use USB mode |

**Expected Accuracy:**
- **Best Case (USB):** �10-15ms
- **WiFi Mode:** �30-40ms
- **For Comparison:** MultiGP standard is �50ms

### Gate Pass Classification

**Gate 1 (Hole Shot):**
- First pass after race start
- Timer already running
- Shows as "Gate 1" in lap table
- Not included in fastest lap calculation

**Subsequent Laps:**
- Numbered Lap 1, 2, 3...
- Delta time calculated from previous lap
- Included in statistics

**Why Separate Gate 1:**
- Reflects actual racing terminology
- First pass timing is less consistent (starting position varies)
- Best lap comparison should exclude hole shot

### Announcement Formats

Three levels of verbosity:

#### Format 1: Pilot + Lap + Time (Full)

**Example:** "Louis Lap 5, 12.34"

**Components:**
1. Phonetic pilot name (or pilot name if not set)
2. "Lap" literal
3. Lap number
4. Lap time (seconds.milliseconds)

**Audio Construction:**
```
phonetic_name.mp3 + lap.mp3 + 5.mp3 + time_12_34.mp3
```

**Best For:** Multi-pilot events, spectators

#### Format 2: Lap + Time

**Example:** "Lap 5, 12.34"

**Components:**
1. "Lap" literal
2. Lap number
3. Lap time

**Best For:** Single pilot, less distraction

#### Format 3: Time Only (Minimal)

**Example:** "12.34"

**Components:**
1. Lap time only

**Best For:** Focus on flying, minimal audio

### Phonetic Name System

**Purpose:**  
Ensure correct pronunciation of pilot names.

**How It Works:**
1. User enters "Phonetic Name" in Configuration
2. If empty, falls back to "Pilot Name"
3. Name sent to TTS engine
4. ElevenLabs: Pre-generated with name
5. PiperTTS: Synthesizes in real-time

**Examples:**

| Pilot Name | Phonetic Name | TTS Output |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| Louis | Louie | "Louie Lap 5..." |
| Xavier | Zavier | "Zavier Lap 5..." |
| Nguyen | Win | "Win Lap 5..." |
| Siobhan | Shiv-awn | "Shiv-awn Lap 5..." |

**Tips:**
- Spell phonetically (how it sounds)
- Use hyphens for syllable breaks
- Test with "Generate Audio" button

### Announcer Types

#### None
- Silent mode
- Only buzzer for race start
- Minimal distraction

#### Beep Only
- Short beep on each lap
- No voice
- Audio cue without speech

#### Lap Time (Standard)
- Announces every lap
- Full details per format setting
- **Most popular mode**

#### 2 Consecutive Laps
- Announces every 2 laps combined
- Example: "Laps 3 and 4, 25.67 seconds"
- Good for longer races (10+ laps)

#### 3 Consecutive Laps
- Announces every 3 laps combined
- Example: "Laps 3, 4, and 5, 38.91 seconds"
- Consistency-focused racing

### Playback Speed Control

**Range:** 0.1 - 2.0  
**Default:** 1.0 (normal)  
**Recommended:** 1.2 - 1.4

**Effect:**
- Speeds up or slows down pre-recorded audio
- Does not affect pitch (time-stretching)
- Faster = less audio overlap on quick laps

**Implementation:**
- I2S audio playback with adjustable sample rate
- 1.0 = 44100 Hz
- 1.5 = 66150 Hz (1.5� faster)

## Multi-Client Support

### WebSocket Architecture

**Server:**
- WebSocket server on port 81
- Up to 8 simultaneous clients
- Broadcast events to all clients
- Clients can send commands

**Connection Flow:**
```
Client ? ws://192.168.4.1:81 ? ESP32 WebSocket Server
ESP32 ? Broadcast event ? All connected clients
```

**Event Types:**
- `lap` - Lap detected
- `raceStart` - Race starting
- `raceStop` - Race stopped
- `configUpdate` - Config changed
- `rssiUpdate` - RSSI value (calibration)

**Message Format:**
```json
{
  "type": "lap",
  "data": {
    "lapTime": 12340,
    "lapNumber": 3,
    "totalLaps": 3,
    "timestamp": 45678
  }
}
```

### Use Cases

#### 1. Race Director + Spectators

**Setup:**
- Race director uses USB (Electron app)
- Spectators connect via WiFi (phones, tablets)

**Behavior:**
- Director controls race (low latency)
- Spectators view live updates
- All see same data synchronously

#### 2. Pilot + Timing Display

**Setup:**
- Pilot views on phone (WiFi)
- External monitor shows OSD overlay (WiFi)

**Behavior:**
- Pilot starts/stops race
- Timing display shows lap times
- Clean separation of concerns

#### 3. Multiple Timing Screens

**Setup:**
- Multiple monitors around track
- All connected via WiFi

**Behavior:**
- Synchronized race display
- Different views possible (table, charts, OSD)

### Transport Abstraction

**Design:**
- `TransportManager` class handles all clients
- Broadcasts to WiFi + USB simultaneously
- Commands from any transport processed equally

**Code Structure:**
```cpp
class TransportManager {
  std::vector<Transport*> transports;
  
  void broadcast(String event) {
    for (auto transport : transports) {
      transport->send(event);
    }
  }
  
  void handleCommand(String command) {
    // Process command (same for all transports)
  }
};
```

**Benefits:**
- Add new transport types easily (Bluetooth future?)
- Unified command handling
- Consistent behavior across connections
