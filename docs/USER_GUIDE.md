## Calibration

** Most Important Step** - Proper calibration is critical for accurate timing.

### Understanding RSSI Thresholds

FPVGate detects laps by monitoring RSSI (signal strength) changes:

1. **Enter RSSI** - Threshold to START watching for a lap
2. **Exit RSSI** - Threshold to STOP watching and record lap

**The Peak:**
- RSSI peaks when drone is closest to gate
- Time of peak = lap time recorded
- Lap only counts if RSSI rises above Enter, peaks, then falls below Exit

### Calibration Procedure

#### Step 1: Prepare

1. **Power on drone** and wait 30 seconds (VTx warm-up)
2. **Check frequency** - Configuration -> Pilot Info -> Band/Channel
3. **Position drone** - One gate distance away (~3-6 feet)
4. **Navigate** to Calibration tab

#### Step 2: Observe RSSI

1. **Watch the graph** - Real-time RSSI value shown
2. **Move drone to gate** - Note the peak RSSI value
3. **Move drone away** - Note the valley RSSI value

**Example Readings:**
- At gate: Peak = 150
- Away: Valley = 80-100

#### Step 3: Set Thresholds

**Enter RSSI:**
- Set **2-5 points below** observed peak
- Example: Peak = 150 -> Enter = 145

**Exit RSSI:**
- Set **8-10 points below** Enter RSSI
- Example: Enter = 145 -> Exit = 135

**Rule:** Enter must always be higher than Exit

#### Step 4: Test

1. **Fly drone through gate** - Watch for green crossing zone
2. **Check lap table** - Should register one clean lap
3. **Adjust if needed:**
   - Missing laps? Lower Enter by 5
   - False laps? Raise Exit by 5

### Good vs Bad Calibration

** Good Calibration:**
```
RSSI  �     /\
      �    /  \
      �   /    \     ? Single clean peak
Enter +--/------\---
      � /        \
Exit  +/----------\-
      +--------------- Time
Result: 1 lap counted 
```

** Bad Calibration (Thresholds too low):**
```
RSSI  �   /\/\        ? Multiple peaks!
      �  /    \
Enter +-/------\---
      �/        \
Exit  /----------\-
      +--------------- Time
Result: 3 laps counted 
```

### Calibration Tips

**Missing Laps:**
- Lower Enter RSSI by 5 points
- Check VTx frequency matches
- Ensure VTx warmed up (30 seconds)
- Verify antenna on RX5808

**False Laps (Too Many):**
- Increase Minimum Lap Time (Configuration)
- Raise Exit RSSI by 5 points
- Move timer further from flight path
- Reduce RF interference

**Inconsistent Detection:**
- Wait for VTx to fully warm up
- Check power supply stability
- Re-calibrate when flying with others (RF noise)
- Verify RX5808 connections

**Flying with Other Pilots:**
- Lower both thresholds by 3-5 points
- Accounts for RF noise from other VTxs
- May need per-session adjustment
